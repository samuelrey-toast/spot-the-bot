# spot-the-bot
Build collaborative playlists with friends.

## Installation
TODO

## Usage
`go build && ./spot-the-bot`

You will then be prompted to authorize Spot to create playlists for a Spotify user. This _could_ be your own personal account, but **we recommend you create a separate account for Spot**.

### Commands
Command | Description
------- | -----------
`!join` | Jump into the queue of people that want to start a playlist.
`!leave` | Jump out of the queue.
`!list` | View the queue.
`!next` | Move yourself to the back of the queue if you are at the front.
`!create` | Make a new playlist if you are at the front of the queue. Spot will send you the link to the playlist. You will add a handful of songs (4-6) and share the playlist with the rest of the group.

**Anybody can add to the playlist, not just people in the queue!**
